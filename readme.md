Easily display Facebook's new Page feed using a customizable widget or shortcode - now supports 130+ languages!

## Description
### Overview
This plugin uses Facebook Graph API v2.3 to generate a Facebook Page feed. Many sites are currently running Facebook Like Boxes which will become **deprecated on June 23rd, 2015**. The Page Plugin lets you easily embed and promote any Facebook Page on your website. Just like on Facebook, your visitors can like and share the Page without having to leave your site.

### Widget Instructions
1. Add a customizable Facebook widget through Appearance -> Widgets.
2. Choose *Simple Facebook Page Widget*.
3. Update the *Facebook Page URL* and click Save.

See the [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-facebook-twitter-widget/screenshots/) for examples.

### Shortcode Instructions
Basic Shortcode Example:

`[facebook-page href="facebook"]`

Custom Shortcode Example:

`[facebook-page href="facebook" width="300" height="800" align="left" hide_cover="false" show_facepile="false" show_posts="true"]`

**Note:** If your *Facebook Page URL* is https://facebook.com/facebook then please enter `facebook` as the href argument.
