== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =

The easiest way to install this plugin is automatically through WordPress because it will handle all of the file transferring. To get started, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field, type "Simple Facebook Widget" and hit Enter. Find the plugin with the icon with "SIMPLE" in all caps. You can install it by clicking "Install Now".

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

It is recommended that you keep this plugin up-to-date. This plugin utilizes [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

See the [plugin description](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-facebook-twitter-widget/) for instructions.

See the [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-facebook-twitter-widget/screenshots/) for examples.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you make this plugin responsive? =

Yes and no. The minimum width of this widget is 280px and the maximum is 500px. The minimum height is 130px. This is set by Facebook & I have no control over it. If you figure out a way to hack this, then please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/irkanu/simple-facebook-page-widget). :)

= Is your plugin going to work if someone from another country visits my site? =

It depends. Some countries block websites like Twitter & Facebook, so this widget may not work for international viewers. However, if there is interest in a fallback in the scenario in which this happens, then I'll consider it.

= Does the visitor have to be logged in to Facebook to see the widget? =

Currently, yes. Please see this [support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/unowned-facebook-pages-are-not-supported) to understand why. Again, if there is interest in a fallback in the scenario in which this happens, I'll be happy to consider it.

= Do I have to create my own custom Facebook App? =

Nope, but you can if you'd like.
